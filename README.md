# AptoBits
Open source bits and bobs for web development.

## [AptoCarousel](/carousel)
I will be writing a blog post on this detailing everything, but the style.less should 
highlight pretty well how things are laid out in CSS. There is some information in its
own [readme file](/carousel/readme.md).

## [RadioColors](/radiocolor)
A simple bit of code that could allow you to make customisable color palettes (as an
example). As usual, no JavaScript; just HTML5 and CSS3 with transitions. See the 
[readme file](/radiocolor/readme.md).
