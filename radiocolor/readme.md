# Radio Colors
 The proposed usage of this might be a user selecting from a range of colors,
perhaps to help create a color palette of some sort. Here is a simple bit of
code to create a pop-out list of these. No JavaScript required, all
CSS3 & HTML5.


## Usage notes
 Official documentation may suggest that :checked will notice the selected
property (there is no official :selected), browsers only appear to recognise the
checked property when dealing with CSS. Ensure you use both when selecting the
default value.


## Tested browsers
* Microsoft Edge (Windows 10)
* Mozilla Firefox (Windows/Android)
